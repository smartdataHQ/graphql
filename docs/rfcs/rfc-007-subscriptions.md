# Subscriptions

# Problem

Our users would like to use [GraphQL Subscriptions](https://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/) to get real-time updates on their data.

# Requirements

## Must have

-   Subscribe to the following events:
    -   CREATE
    -   UPDATE
    -   DELETE
-   Ability to filter which nodes are subscribed to (i.e. `where` clause).
-   Ability to horizontally scale - either now, or able to do so without breaking in the future.
-   Wherever possible, events are ordered.
-   Events are fired individually.
-   We won't mutate our users' databases - no metadata.
-   All events are sent (for example, if node created and then deleted, we get both events).
-   Database transactions must be successful - no optimisticness.
-   Garbage collection of old subscriptions.
-   Some form of auth validation.
-   `@neo4j/graphql` should still run on browser

## Should have

-   To subscribe to the following events:
    -   CONNECT
    -   DISCONNECT
-   Relationship property updates

## Could have

-   Subscriptions to Interface and Union types
-   OGM support
-   We return "full objects" including nested relationships (for example, a movie subscription must return type `Movie` with nested `actors`)

## Won't have

-   Events from changes outside of GraphQL
-   Events triggered from custom Cypher
-   Support for subscriptions on browser

# Proposed Solution

## Type Definitions

Considering the following definitions:

```graphql
type Movie {
    title: String!
}
```

The subscription type generated by this proposed solution would look like:

```graphql
type Movie {
    title: String!
}

type MovieCreatedEvent {
    event: EventType!
    movieCreated: Movie!
}

type MovieUpdatedEvent {
    event: EventType!
    movieUpdated: Movie!
    previousState: Movie!
}

type MovieDeletedEvent {
    event: EventType!
    movieDeleted: Movie!
}

type Subscription {
    movieCreated(where: MovieWhere): MovieCreatedEvent!
    movieUpdated(where: MovieWhere): MovieUpdatedEvent!
    movieDeleted(where: MovieWhere): MovieDeletedEvent!
}
```

## Usage Examples & Cypher Queries

## Setup

Subscriptions are an opt-in feature, to be activated when passing a subscriptions plugin to the Neo4jGraphQL schema

```typescript
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    plugins: {
        subscriptions: new SubscriptionsPlugin(), // e.g. SubscriptionsRedisPlugin()
    },
});
```

### Subscribing to creation

If a user wanted to subscribe to all movies being created, they could run the following subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
    movieCreated {
        createdMovie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

Whenever a create operation is executed, metadata regarding the operation will be generated and returned:

```cypher
CALL {
    WITH [] AS meta
    CREATE (this0:Movie)
    SET this0.title = "title"
    WITH meta + { event: "create", id: id(this0), properties: { old: null, new: this0 { .* } }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Movie" } AS meta, this0
    RETURN this0, meta AS this0_meta
}
WITH this0, this0_meta AS meta
RETURN [this0 { .title }] AS data, meta
```

### Subscribing to update

If a user wants to get the updates of a particular movie, they could use a `where` argument:

```graphql
subscription {
    movieUpdated(where: { title: "Titanic" }) {
        updatedMovie {
            title
        }
        previousState {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, 2 states are returned, before and after the update.

Whenever a create operation is executed, metadata regarding the operation will be generated and returned:

```cypher
WITH [] AS meta
MATCH (this:Movie)
WHERE this.title = $this_title

WITH this { .* } AS oldProps, this, meta
SET this.title = $this_update_title
WITH this, meta + { event: "update", id: id(this), properties: { old: oldProps, new: this { .* } }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Movie" } AS meta

WITH this, meta
UNWIND meta AS m
RETURN collect(DISTINCT this { .title }) AS data, collect(DISTINCT m) as meta
```

Having the old properties and the new properties to hand means we can actually check whether anything changed as part of the update operation.
Mutations without changes should not trigger update events.

### Subscribing to delete

If a user wants to get the deletion of a particular movie, they could use a `where` argument:

```graphql
subscription {
    movieDeleted(where: { title: "Titanic" }) {
        deletedMovie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

Whenever a delete operation is executed, metadata regarding the operation will be generated and returned:

```cypher
WITH [] AS meta
MATCH (this:Movie)
WHERE this.title = $this_title
WITH this, meta + { event: "delete", id: id(this), properties: { old: this { .* }, new: null }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Movie" } AS meta
DETACH DELETE this
WITH meta
UNWIND meta AS m
RETURN collect(DISTINCT m) AS meta
```

### Subscribe to relationships

Events `connect` and `disconnect` should be available to provide support for subscriptions to relationships.

These events should contain the following information:

-   The connected/disconnected relationship properties
-   Source and target nodes with the top level properties
-   Relationship name: This should, somehow, map to the name given to the property. The internal relationship type should **not** be used.
-   Direction of the relationship

Assuming the following typedefs:

```graphql
type Actor {
    name: String!
    movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT, properties: "ActedIn")
    follows: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "FOLLOWS", direction: OUT, properties: "Follows")
    followedBy: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "FOLLOWS", direction: IN, properties: "Follows")
}

type Movie {
    title: String!
    actors: [Actors!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
    director: Actor @relationship(type: "DIRECTED", direction: IN)
}

interface ActedIn @relationshipProperties {
    role: String!
}

interface Follows @relationshipProperties {
    date: Date
}
```

All of the subscriptions are attached to nodes, the events will trigger whenever a connection is made or destroyed to that node respectively. For these events, the following rules apply:

-   An event will be triggered for all relationship fields connected, meaning that a connection can trigger up to 2 events (source and target nodes)
-   Only connections with a relationship defined in the schema will be triggered

For example, the following connections will trigger these events:

-   Actor - movies: Will trigger 2 events (actor-movies, movie-actors)
-   Actor - follows: Will trigger 2 events (actor-follows, actors-followedBy)
-   Movie - director: Will trigger 1 event (movie-director), the opposite will not be triggered as it is not defined in Actor type

**Payload**
The payload will contain the root fields of the node triggering the event, (e.g. `actor`).
It will also contain the `relationship` field, which will contain **all** of the relationships defined in the root node. These relationships will each contain the properties and the related node, each event will only contain one of these, with the rest being nullable.

Additionally the fields `direction` and `relationshipName` will contain the relationship direction and field name respectively.

```graphql
actorConnected {
   connectedActor: ActorEventPayload! // The node subscribed to (Actor), regardless of direction
   timestamp: Float!
   event // CONNECT / DISCONNECT
   relationshipName: "movies" // The name of the relationship prop (movies or follows)
   relationship {
      movies { // nullable
        role: String!
        node {
            title
        }
      }
      follows { // nullable
        ...relationshipProperties
        node
      }
   }
   direction: IN | OUT
}
```

With this payload, a client either return only the data of the relevant events, or retrieve the data of any event returned the following way:

```js
const relationshipProperties = data.relationship[data.relationshipName];
```

> Note that the top level node will be the one from the subscription, regardless of relationship direction.

An example of the full payload:

```graphql
subscription {
    actorConnected() {
        connectedActor {
            name
        }
        relationship {
          movies {
            role
            node {
              title
            }
          }
          follows {
            date
            node {
              name
            }
          }
          followedBy {
            date
            node {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      relationshipName
    }
}
```

**Filtering**  
Filtering can be done with a `where` input field that will have the following properties

-   `actor`: Filter of top level properties of the node (e.g. `actor`) from which the subscription is done
-   `relationshipName` can be filtered
-   All of the `relationships` can be filtered either by related node or properties, by using the same properties as in the payload, only top-level properties of the related node can be filtered
-   `direction`

For instance, subscribing to only `actedIn` connections:

```graphql
subscription {
    movieConnected(
        where: {
            relationshipName: "actors"
            connectedMovie: { title: "The Matrix" }
            relationship: { actors: { node: { name: "Keanu" } } }
        }
    ) {
        connectedMovie {
            title
        }
        relationship {
            actors {
                node {
                    name
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

-   Relationship filtering can be cut out of scope if needed

#### Risks and Limitations on connections

-   (blocker) FOREACH on nested Connect, disconnect and delete
-   (unknown) ConnectOrCreate
-   (non-blocker) Currently, connection works as a idempotent operation with `MERGE`, the event should only trigger when a new connection is made.
-   (non-blocker) (Dis)Connections should be triggered regardless of the way the connection is created. (e.g. ActorUpdate or MovieUpdate as top level operation).
-   (out of scope) Subscription to changes to the relationship properties are out of scope, only creation/deletion of relationships trigger events.

#### Cypher Examples

These are proposals on how to inject the given subscriptions into Cypher, the changes require for the source node, target node and relationship variables to be available on the metadata generation

**Connect**  
Whenever a create or update operation is executed, metadata regarding the connection events will be created

Assuming the following update GraphQL query:

```graphql
mutation UpdateMovies {
    updateMovies(
        where: { title: "The Matrix" }
        update: { title: "Another Matrix" }
        connect: { actors: [{ where: { node: { name_NOT: "Keanu Reeves" } } }] }
    ) {
        movies {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

It will generate the Cypher query:

```cypher
WITH [] AS meta
MATCH (this:`Movie`)
WHERE this.title = $param0
WITH this { .* } AS oldProps, this, meta
CALL {
	WITH *
	SET this.title = $this_update_title
	RETURN meta as update_meta
}
WITH *, update_meta as meta
WITH this, meta + { event: "update", id: id(this), properties: { old: oldProps, new: this { .* } }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Movie" } AS meta
WITH this, meta
CALL {
	WITH this, meta
	OPTIONAL MATCH (this_connect_actors0_node:Person)
	WHERE NOT (this_connect_actors0_node.name = $this_connect_actors0_node_param0)
	FOREACH(_ IN CASE WHEN this IS NULL THEN [] ELSE [1] END |
		FOREACH(_ IN CASE WHEN this_connect_actors0_node IS NULL THEN [] ELSE [1] END |
            MERGE (this)<-[this_connect_actors0_relationship:ACTED_IN]-(this_connect_actors0_node)
            >>> Here meta should be updated, however, foreach doesn't allow for return
		)
	)
	RETURN count(*) AS connect_this_connect_actors_Person
}
WITH *
WITH *
UNWIND meta AS m
RETURN collect(DISTINCT this { .title }) AS data, collect(DISTINCT m) as meta

```

With a create:

```cypher
CALL {
WITH [] AS meta
    CREATE (this0:Actor)
    SET this0.name = $this0_name
    CREATE (this0_actedIn0_node:Movie)
    SET this0_actedIn0_node.title = $this0_actedIn0_node_title
    WITH meta + { event: "create", id: id(this0_actedIn0_node), properties: { old: null, new: this0_actedIn0_node { .* } }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Movie" } AS meta, this0, this0_actedIn0_node
    MERGE (this0)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(this0_actedIn0_node)
    >>>
    WITH meta + { event: "connect", id_from: id(this0), id_to: id(this0_actedIn0_node), id: id(r), properties: {from: this0 {.*}, to: this0_actedIn0_node {.*}, relationship: r {.*}} ,timestamp: timestamp(), relationshipName: "ACTED_IN" }
    <<<
    WITH meta + { event: "create", id: id(this0), properties: { old: null, new: this0 { .* } }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Actor" } AS meta, this0
    RETURN this0, meta AS this0_meta
}
WITH this0, this0_meta AS meta
RETURN [
this0 { .name, actedIn: [ (this0)-[:ACTED_IN]->(this0_actedIn:Movie)   | this0_actedIn { .title } ] }] AS data, meta
```

**Disconnect**  
Whenever a delete or update operation is executed, metadata regarding the connection events will be created:

```cypher
WITH [] AS meta
MATCH (this:Movie)
WHERE this.title = $this_title
WITH this, meta + { event: "delete", id: id(this), properties: { old: this { .* }, new: null }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Movie" } AS meta
WITH this, meta
OPTIONAL MATCH (this)<-[this_actors0_relationship:ACTED_IN]-(this_actors0:Actor)
WHERE this_actors0.name = $this_deleteMovies.args.delete.actors[0].where.node.name
WITH this, meta, collect(DISTINCT this_actors0) as this_actors0_to_delete
WITH this, this_actors0_to_delete, REDUCE(m=meta, n IN this_actors0_to_delete | m + { event: "delete", id: id(n), properties: { old: n { .* }, new: null }, timestamp: timestamp(), typename: "Actor" }) AS meta
>>>
WITH this, this_actors0_to_delete, REDUCE(m=meta, n IN this_actors0_to_delete | m + { event: "disconnect", id_from: id(this0), id_to: id(n), id: id(this_actors0_relationship), properties: {from: this {.*}, to: n {.*}, relationship: this_actors0_relationship {.*}} ,timestamp: timestamp(), relationshipName: "ACTED_IN" }) AS meta
<<<
FOREACH(x IN this_actors0_to_delete | DETACH DELETE x)
DETACH DELETE this
WITH meta
UNWIND meta AS m
RETURN collect(DISTINCT m) AS meta
```

With the provided metadata, subscription events should be triggered for both nodes, taking into account all of the relationship properties to generate the payload.

Note that these should be triggered on **any** creation/deletion of relationships, this includes top-level and nested mutations.

### Excluding types from subscriptions

As it is currently possible to exclude specific operations for queries and mutations, it should be possible to have some exclude capabilities for subscription operations on specified types.

To achieve this, the proposed solution uses the `@exclude` directive by extending the `ExcludeOperation` options from `[CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE]` to include a dedicated argument `SUBSCRIBE` referring to subscriptions.

The list of options would thus look like `[CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, SUBSCRIBE]`.

#### Usage Example

Given the following type definitions (notice `@exclude` is not being used):

```graphql
type Movie {
    title: String!
    released: Int!
}
```

the library will auto-generate the following types in the schema:

```graphql
type Query {
    movies(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions): [Movie!]!
    moviesAggregate(where: MovieWhere): MovieAggregateSelection!
    moviesConnection(first: Int, after: String, where: MovieWhere, sort: [MovieSort]): MoviesConnection!
}

type Mutation {
    createMovies(input: [MovieCreateInput!]!): CreateMoviesMutationResponse!
    deleteMovies(where: MovieWhere): DeleteInfo!
    updateMovies(where: MovieWhere, update: MovieUpdateInput): UpdateMoviesMutationResponse!
}

type Subscription {
    movieCreated(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieCreatedEvent!
    movieUpdated(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieUpdatedEvent!
    movieDeleted(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieDeletedEvent!
}
```

By excluding the `CREATE` and `DELETE` operations on the movie type like so:

```graphql
type Movie @exclude(operations: [CREATE, DELETE]) {
    title: String!
    released: Int!
}
```

the auto-generated types will change to:

```graphql
type Query {
    movies(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions): [Movie!]!
    moviesAggregate(where: MovieWhere): MovieAggregateSelection!
    moviesConnection(first: Int, after: String, where: MovieWhere, sort: [MovieSort]): MoviesConnection!
}

type Mutation {
    updateMovies(where: MovieWhere, update: MovieUpdateInput): UpdateMoviesMutationResponse!
}

type Subscription {
    movieCreated(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieCreatedEvent!
    movieUpdated(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieUpdatedEvent!
    movieDeleted(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieDeletedEvent!
}
```

In other words, the `createMovies` and `deleteMovies` mutations have not been generated, the query type was not impacted because it does not do any create/ delete operations and the subscriptions were not impacted because of the current behavior.

The proposed solution would would make use of a new operation in the exclude list:

```graphql
type Movie @exclude(operations: [SUBSCRIBE, CREATE, DELETE]) {
    title: String!
    released: Int!
}
```

and have as outcome the exclusion of the subscription fields altogether:

```graphql
type Query {
  movies(where: MovieWhere, options: MovieOptions): [Movie!]!
  moviesAggregate(where: MovieWhere): MovieAggregateSelection!
  moviesConnection(first: Int, after: String, where: MovieWhere, sort: [MovieSort]): MoviesConnection!
}

type Mutation {
  updateMovies(where: MovieWhere, update: MovieUpdateInput): UpdateMoviesMutationResponse!
}

type Subscription {
  # no fields generated
}
```

#### Out of Scope

1. At this point we are **not** yet considering fine-grain control on excluding specific subscription operations. Either all subscription operations on a specified type are excluded, or none. This means nothing like this will be possible for now:

```graphql
type Movie @exclude(operations: [SUBSCRIBE_CREATE]) {
  ...
}
# generating..
type Subscription {
  # no create operation
  movieUpdated(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieUpdatedEvent!
  movieDeleted(where: MovieSubscriptionWhere): MovieDeletedEvent!
}
```

2. Preserving the current behavior of the `@exclude` directive, it will only be possible to add it to GraphQL types. This means it will not be possible to ignore just particular fields of a type.

```graphql
type Movie {
    title: String! @exclude(operations: [SUBSCRIBE])
    released: Int!
}
```

## Plugin Implementation

Subscriptions will be made available through a plugin, for which we will initially provide a "local" implementation of,
which will not scale horizontally. Providing a plugin API means that later down the line, a plugin can be built which emits
metadata regarding Mutation operations, to be consumed by other instances in a load balanced group.

The plugin will use an `EventEmitter` which is consumed from within each instance. Whenever metadata is returned from a Mutation,
it should be passed to the `publish` function which will handle it appropriately for the implementation.

This plugin definition will look roughly like:

```ts
class Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsPlugin {
    public events: EventEmitter;

    constructor() {
        this.events = new EventEmitter();
    }

    public abstract publish(eventMeta: SubscriptionsEvent);
}
```

The "local" implementation of this will look something like:

```ts
class Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsLocalPlugin extends Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsPlugin {
    public publish(eventMeta: SubscriptionsEvent) {
        this.events.emit(eventMeta);
    }
}
```

And in rough pseudocode, an implementation of this using an AMQP broker would look roughly like:

```ts
class Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsAMQPPlugin extends Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsPlugin {
    private amqpConnection;

    public publish(eventMeta: SubscriptionsEvent) {
        amqpConnection.publish(eventMeta);
    }

    constructor(brokerUrl, username, password) {
        this.amqpConnection = new AMQPConnection(brokerUrl, username, password);
        this.subscribe();
    }

    private async subscribe() {
        amqpConnection.on("message", (message) => {
            this.events.emit(message);
        });
    }
}
```

### Alternative interface

Alternatively, the plugin interface exposed to the users could be akin to:

```ts
interface Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsPlugin {
    on(eventName: string | symbol, listener: (...args: any[]) => void): this;
    publish(eventMeta: SubscriptionsEvent);
}
```

This would allow for a slightly more flexible interface, not relying on explicit implementations of EventEmitter.

> NOTE: Our current implementation uses the `on()` function from EventEmitter which takes an EventEmitter, that may make this solution hard or not viable.

## Events vs PubSub

Most GraphQL implementations are based on PubSub (e.g. [graphql-subscriptions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-subscriptions)). However, PubSub
is not a standard, making it hard to provide a library cross-compatible with different servers.

The proposed solution implements an `EventEmitter` and a `publish` method as its interface, this ensures an standard interface that may be used with
PubSub, or any custom solution.

### PubSub Support

The proposed solution could be used with most PubSub implementations, by subscribing to it and triggering the eventEmitter locally on a custom plugin:

```ts
class MySubscriptionsPlugin extends Neo4jGraphQLSubscriptionsPlugin {
    private pubsub;

    constructor(pubsub) {
        super();
        this.pubsub = pubsub;
        this.pubsub.subscribe((payload) => {
            this.events.emit(payload.event, payload);
        });
    }

    public publish(eventMeta: SubscriptionsEvent) {
        this.pubsub.publish(eventMeta.event, eventMeta);
    }
}
```

However, due to the hegemony of PubSub, it may be convenient to provide a syntactic sugar support for PubSub. For example:

Provide a custom PubSub Plugin, similar to the example above;

```js
import { PubsubSubscriptipnPlugin } from "@neo4j/graphql-subscriptions";

const subscriptionPlugin = new PubsubSubcriptionPlugin(pubsub);
```

Alternatively, provide native PubSub option on subscription setup:

```typescript
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    subscriptions: new PubSub(), // Pubsub specification, compatible with graphql-subscriptions
});
```

## Resolvers

A subscription require 2 fields, a `subscribe` method and a `resolver`:

```ts
{
    subscribe: async function *subscribe(where, context) {
        // Filter events
    }
    resolve: async function(payload) {
        // Format and return payload given by subscribe
    },
}

```

## Filtering

Subscriptions can be created with a filter (`where`) statement, this ensures that only subscriptions matching these filters will be triggered.

As an example:

```graphql
subscription SubscribeToMatrix {
    movieCreated(where: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
        event
        createdMovie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

This will subscribe to any newly created movie with the title "The Matrix".
The proposed filters should mimic, as possible, the `query` where filters, Including support for:

-   `OR`.
-   `AND`.
-   `_IN`, `_NOT_IN`.
-   `_CONTAINS`, `_NOT_CONTAINS`.
-   `_STARTS_WITH`, `_ENDS_WITH` and `_NOT` equivalents.
-   `_LT`, `_LTE`, `_GT`, `_GTE`.
-   `_MATCHES`.

> Due to limitations on filtering, only root level fields can be filtered, aggregations, connections and relationships are out of scope.

### Update events

Update events, by default, will filter on the previous state, for example, the following subscription:

```graphql
subscription SubscriptionToUpdate {
    movieUpdated(where: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
        event
    }
}
```

Will be triggered by the mutation:

```graphql
mutation Mutation {
    updateMovies(where: { title: "The Matrix" }, update: { title: "Not a movie" }) {
        movies {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

But not by the subscription:

```graphql
mutation Mutation {
    updateMovies(where: { title: "Cornetto Movie" }, update: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
        movies {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

To support use cases for subscriptions to an updated value, update subscriptions should also provide filters targeting the new value by prepending `NEW`, for instance:

-   `NEW_title`.
-   `NEW_title_GT`.

This would allow for subscriptions such as:

```graphql
subscription SubscribeToConfirmedUsers {
    userUpdated(where: { AND: [{ status: "pending" }, { NEW_status: "confirmed" }] }) {
        name
        status
    }
}
```

## Auth

A new operation `SUBSCRIBE` to deal with authorization on subscriptions, this operation will follow the same syntax and rules as any other operation, but with more
limited scope, allowing only for top-level properties validation (same limitations as `where`).

### Authentication

```graphql
type Post @auth(rules: [{ operations: [SUBSCRIBE], isAuthenticated: true }]) {
    title: String!
}
```

If the user is not authenticated, the subscription request will fail.

### Allow

Works as usual, but not supported throughout relationships:

```graphql
type User @auth(rules: [{ operations: [SUBSCRIBE], allow: { id: "$jwt.sub" } }]) {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}
```

This requires `jwt` to be available in the context on subscription resolver. If a rule does not match, the subscription will not be sent.

### Bind

Bind does not make sense on subscriptions, as it is intended for mutations. So bind is ignored for SUBSCRIBE operations

### Roles

Roles should work as usual, the subscription request should error if the role does not match.

### Where

Where filter in the auth directive should work under the same limitations and behaviour as the subscriptions filtering. With any subscription event not matching
this where not being sent.

## Extra fields in subscription

The following should be available along with the data payload:

-   **event**: The event that triggered this event (`CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
-   **timestamp**: The timestamp the event was generated, this may be needed to ensure order consistency on horizontal scaled subscriptions.
-   **previousState** (only for updates): State of the node before the modification.

## Nested fields

Due to subscriptions relying on the `meta` data returned by the queries, only top-level properties of the node are available to return or filter.

To properly support nested queries, follow-up queries to the database, after the subscription has been triggered would be required. This may be not viable as each subscription would require an extra request, this not only put a huge load to the database, the subscription itself will take longer to fulfill, instead of close to real-time. Adding some extra metadata and caching subscriptions may help,

Due to this, any nested field queries support should be opt-in.

## Horizontal scalability

### Problem

While subscriptions may be made to an instance, the mutation triggering the subscriptions may happen on a different instance, the library must support
a broker (e.g. Redis or AMQP).

The plugin implementing eventEmitter is a flexible enough solution as to allow users implementing their own broker to support horizontal scalability, but some well-known providers should be provided by default.

The following list contains an incomplete list of providers that could be supported

-   [Redis](https://redis.io/)
-   [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) & AMQP
-   [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (through [pg-ipc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-ipc))
-   [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
-   [Google PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub)

We should also leverage existing PubSub implementations to these services, some of those deprecated, but well known:

-   [graphql-subscriptions](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions)
-   [yoga](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/docs/features/subscriptions)

## Subscriptions transports

This library should **not** implement any transport, and should be, when possible, agnostic of how the subscriptions are delivered, as that is part of the server and user implementation. It is important to make sure that the library works as expected with the most common transport methods.

### Websockets

Most use cases will user WebSockets. The current standard on GraphQL subscriptions delivery through WebSockets is [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws).

While not a high priority, the protocol implemented by [graphql-transport-ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-transport-ws) (deprecated) should also work with the library.

### Server-sent events

An alterantive to websocket are [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events), with [yoga server](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/docs/features/subscriptions) using them for the subscriptions implementation.

# Security Considerations

The addition of subscriptions creates a new entry top-level access for the database, increasing any security risks. The access to subscriptions should be handled by the `@auth` directive (described above).

Additionally, by the real-time nature of subscriptions, a few extra considerations need to be taken into account:

-   **Denial of service attacks**: Real time updates are susceptible to DOS attacks, as any query may trigger a large number of subscriptions.
-   **Wss**: We need to ensure that our documentation and library is compatible with WebSocket Secure (WSS).
-   Other transports risks: Any new transport (e.g. SSE) may pose new security risks that need to be addressed per case.

> Due to these security considerations, any form of subscriptions must be opt-in for new and existing users.

# Risks

-   Maintaining order of events being fired
    -   For a single instance this can be guaranteed. On multiple-servers implementations, broker network may lead to unordered events in some cases. The addition of timestamps to the payload would be beneficial in these cases.
-   Ensure consistency of events data with data in the database
-   Make sure it works across popular PubSub Engine implementations (for example <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/#production-pubsub-libraries>)
-   Make sure it works with `@auth` directive - users shouldn't be able to listen to events for types they can't access
-   Efficiency of Cypher queries - do we fetch all properties of a node and allow GraphQL runtime to filter down, or only the properties in the selection set?

# Discarded solutions

## Solution 1: Subscription field per node type

The subscription type generated by this proposed solution would look like:

```graphql
enum Event {
    CREATE
    UPDATE
    DELETE
}

type MovieEvent {
    event: Event!
    movie: Movie!
}

type Subscription {
    subscribeToMovies(events: [Event!], where: MovieWhere): MovieEvent!
}
```

## Usage Examples

If a user wanted to subscribe to all movies being created, they could run the following subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
    subscribeToMovies(events: [CREATE]) {
        movie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

If a user wants to get the updates of a particular movie, they could use a `where` argument:

```graphql
subscription {
    subscribeToMovies(events: [UPDATE], where: { title: "Titanic" }) {
        movie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

For subscribing to multiple events, it would be sensible to query also for the `event` field which could then be used for filtering which event triggered the notification:

```graphql
subscription {
    subscribeToMovies(events: [CREATE, UPDATE]) {
        event
        movie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```

If the `event` argument is not provided, it will be assumed that all events want to be listened for:

```graphql
subscription {
    subscribeToMovies {
        event
        movie {
            title
        }
    }
}
```
